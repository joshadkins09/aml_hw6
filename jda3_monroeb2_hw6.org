# (50 points) Regress house price (variable 14) against all others, and use
# leverage, Cook's distance, and standardized residuals to find possible
# outliers. Use plot(your_linear_regression_model) to produce a diagnostic plot
# that allows you to identify possible outliers (points with high residual or
# high leverage or high influence). Give the indices of possible outliers and
# explain why you think they are outliers. The reason being an outlier may not
# be same, so please be sure you understand the plot well. (You can read R
# tutorial provided above if you have any questions).

# (30 points) Remove all points you suspect as outliers, and compute a new
# regression. Reproduce a diagnostic plot that allows you to identify possible
# outliers. We do not require explanations this time.

# (10 points) Apply a Box-Cox transformation (use boxcox command) to the
# dependent variable, what is the best value of the parameter?

# (10 points) Now transform the dependent variable, build a linear regression,
# and check the standardized residuals. If they look acceptable, produce a plot
# of fitted house price against true house price.
